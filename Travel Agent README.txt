?? Travel Agent – Generative AI Assistant
This project demonstrates the development of an AI-powered travel planning assistant using Generative AI techniques. It leverages tools like LangChain and OpenAI to dynamically suggest travel destinations, hotels, flights, and activities based on user preferences, weather, and budget constraints.

?? Project Overview

The goal is to create an intelligent travel agent that:

* Understands user preferences via natural language

* Recommends destinations, accommodations, and attractions

* Utilizes real-time or static data for decision-making

* Uses LangChain agents and toolchains for modular reasoning

?? Technologies & Frameworks

* LangChain – LLM orchestration and multi-agent system

* OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 – Natural language processing

* Python – Backend development

* Pandas / Requests – Data handling and API integration

* Jupyter Notebook – Development environment




?? Features
* ?? Dynamic Destination Selection – Based on weather, budget, or interests

* ??? Hotel & Flight Suggestion – Real or mock API calls for logistics

* ?? Weather Tool – Determines ideal destination based on current/future conditions

* ??? Trip Planner Tool – Creates day-by-day itinerary

* ?? Tool-Chaining – Modular design allows each "tool" (e.g., hotel finder, weather checker) to operate independently within a LangChain Agent framework

* ?? Multi-Turn Conversation Handling – Memory-aware conversations with context retention

?? How It Works
User describes their travel needs in natural language, LangChain ReAct agent interprets the request and activates the appropriate tools

Tools may include:

* Destination recommender

* Weather checker

* Budget matcher

* Hotel or flight search API

Final result: Tailored travel plan (location, date, flight, hotel, attractions)


?? Example Use Cases

* “Find me a sunny beach destination for under $1500 next weekend.”

* “Plan a 3-day cultural trip in Europe with art museums.”

* “Where should I go this month if I want warm weather and cheap hotels?”
