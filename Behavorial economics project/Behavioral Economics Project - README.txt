Behavioral Economics Project – The Impact of Room Design on Team Collaboration
This project explores how physical workspace design affects psychological safety, collaboration, creativity, and group belonging. Specifically, the study compares home-like meeting room environments to formal office spaces to assess their impact on team behavior and perception.

Research Question
Does home-like design of meeting spaces improve collaboration and comfort compared to formal and impersonal room design?

Experimental Design
Participants: ~80 individuals, randomly assigned to:

* Experimental Group: Viewed images of cozy, home-like spaces (warm lighting, soft colors, comfortable furniture)

* Control Group: Viewed images of traditional, formal meeting rooms

Method:

* Participants answered Likert-scale surveys after viewing the image (via Google Forms)

* Topics included: psychological safety, collaboration comfort, creativity, privacy, and team fit

* Analysis was performed in R and Python
