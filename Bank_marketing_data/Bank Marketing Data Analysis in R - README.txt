Bank Marketing Data Analysis in R
This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using several classification algorithms, and evaluation of business ROI.

Project Structure:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Initial visualizations and data exploration.

2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering – Handling unknown values, binning, transformation of categorical features.

3. Modeling – Training and comparing:

4. Logistic Regression with regularization

5. Random Forest

6. XGBoost

7. Performance Metrics – Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Specificity, NPV.

8. AUC-ROC & Gain Charts – Evaluation using ROC curves and cumulative gains.

9. ROI & Cost Analysis – Business-level impact analysis for model performance.
