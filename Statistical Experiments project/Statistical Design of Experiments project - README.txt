Statistical Design of Experiments – Project

This project was developed as part of the "Statistical Design of Experiments" course at Azrieli College of Engineering. It extends a prior project where a web-based information system was created to solve the "Optimal Pickup Station" problem — choosing the bus stop closest to the majority of users based on their addresses.

The current project focuses on applying statistical design of experiments to analyze system usage and user behavior, aiming to inform future development and business decisions.

Project Objective

* Analyze real user behavior using statistical methods

* Evaluate interface and advertising changes via controlled experiments

* Validate insights for strategic product development using robust statistical tests

Notebook (Design_of_Experiments_Project.ipynb)

Contains the full statistical analysis in Python:

* Data import and preparation

* Execution of ANOVA (block design), Wilcoxon, Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis, and post hoc tests

* Visualizations of user behavior (e.g., engagement time, system interactions)

* Result interpretation with p-value calculations

* This notebook serves as the computational engine for analyzing and validating hypotheses from the report.
